### Additional info:
I used Visual Studio Code for Task 1 
and IntelliJ IDEA for Task 2&3&3 (with Git)  <br>
I decided not to use branches <br>
Unused code may be found (refactoring is needed).

# Task 1

* Description of the History tab into a new project
<br>

>The "History" tab is a feature that allows users to track and manage their previous activity or interactions within the application.
><br><br>This tab: <br><br>
*Records past interactions: It stores a log of user actions,  when specific items were edited. <br>
*Provides timestamps: The timestamps associated with each entry indicate the exact time of the interaction. <br>
*Enables backup and restoring: It makes backup of the text and Users may be able to restore segments in the history based on date. <br>
*Offers a chronological view: The history is displayed in a chronological order, with the most recent actions appearing at the top. <br>
<br>Overall, the "History" tab serves as a useful tool for users to review their past activities, identify trends, and potentially troubleshoot any issues or inconsistencies.
